        <h1>Am I saving?</h1>
        <h3>Should I invest in equipment to brew coffee at home, or is it cheaper to just buy coffee at Starbucks? Should I purchase a car or Uber everywhere? This calculator is meant to help you make these types of decisions.</h3>

        <p>Let's focus on the coffee example. I have 2 options:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Purchase equipment and brew at home.</li>
          <li>Don't buy any equipment and purchase a cup of coffee at Starbucks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        For option 1, I would need to buy things like a kettle, a french press, and maybe some filters (let's say this all costs $60). Then, for each additional cup of coffee my only cost would be the coffee beans themselves (let's say $1 per cup). For option 2, I spend $0 on equipment but need to pay Starbucks for each cup of coffee (let's say $3). 
        </p>

        <div id="summary">
          <p>That's a lot of words! In summary...</p>  
          <ul>
            <li>Cost of equipment: The $60 I would spend on coffee equipment (filters, coffee machine, kettle, etc.).</li>
            <li>Cost per unit with equipment: The $1 I need to spend for each cup of coffee, if I buy equipment.</li>
            <li>Cost per unit without equipment: The $3 I need to spend for each cup of coffee I'd buy at Starbucks.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="instructions">
        Click the 'Draw!' button below to compare these two options! (If you'd like to autopopulate the numbers from the coffee example, simply refresh the page.)

        You'll save money by not spending it.
