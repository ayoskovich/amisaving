        <p class="lead">Should I invest in equipment to brew coffee at home or is it cheaper to buy coffee at Starbucks? Should I purchase a car or Uber everywhere? This calculator is meant to help you make these types of decisions.</p>

	<hr>

        <div class="alert alert-secondary" rolw="alert">
        <p>Let's focus on the coffee example. I have 2 options:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Purchase equipment and brew at home.</li>
          <li>Don't buy any equipment and purchase a cup of coffee at Starbucks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        For option 1, I would need to buy things like a kettle, a french press, and maybe some filters. For each additional cup of coffee the only cost would be the coffee beans themselves. </p>
        <p>
        For option 2, I buy any equipment but need to pay Starbucks for each cup of coffee. 
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>That's a lot of words! In summary...</p>  
        <ul>
          <li>Cost of equipment: The $60 I would spend on coffee equipment (filters, coffee machine, kettle, etc.).</li>
          <li>Cost per unit with investment in equipment: The $1 I need to spend for each cup of coffee, if I buy equipment.</li>
          <li>Cost per unit without investment equipment: The $3 I need to spend for each cup of coffee I'd buy at Starbucks.</li>
        </ul>
